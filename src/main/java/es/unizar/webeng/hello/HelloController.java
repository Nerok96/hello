 * with millisecond precision.
 *
 * java.util.Map: An object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys,
 *   each key can map to at most one value.
 *   This interface takes the place of the Dictionary class,
 *   which was a totally abstract class rather than an interface. 
 *   The Map interface provides three collection views,
 *   which allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys,
 *   collection of values, or set of key-value mappings.
 *   The order of a map is defined as the order in which
 *   the iterators on the map's collection views return their elements.
